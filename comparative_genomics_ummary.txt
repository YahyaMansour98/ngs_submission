Summary

- My assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome is very similar to the reference genome (over 99.8% identity).
- I found 32 SNPs and 19 indels between my assembly and the reference.
- All of the reference and assembly sequences are aligned, and almost all bases are covered.
- The assembly is a bit larger than the reference, probably because of some repeats or assembly artifacts.
- Most SNPs are Câ†”T transitions, which is common in viral genomes.
- The number of SNPs and indels is typical for a SARS-CoV-2 isolate and shows my sample is closely related to the reference strain.

Files included:
- snps.txt (SNP/indel list)
- dnadiff_out.report (summary)
- dnadiff_out.snps (detailed SNPs)
- genome_compare.delta (alignment)
- genome_compare.png (alignment plot)
- BLAST.png (screenshot of BLAST search)

This analysis confirms that my assembly is high quality and closely matches the known SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, combined with the blast 
search that showed high matches with OYY16529.1 , OD947758.1 and OD989546.1
(Percent identity is 99.98% or 100%)
